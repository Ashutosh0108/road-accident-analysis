# 🚧 Road Accident Analysis Project

This project analyzes real-world road accident data to uncover high-risk patterns, peak accident timings, vehicle types involved, and the effect of environmental factors. The analysis is done using **SQL**, **Pandas (Python)**, and visualized using **Power BI**.

## 🔧 Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- SQL (Microsoft SQL Server)
- Power BI (for visualization)
- Google Colab (for notebook execution)

## 📊 Key Insights

- 🔥 Most accidents occur at **night** and **early morning**
- 🌧️ Accidents during **rainy/foggy weather** have higher casualty rates
- 🏙️ **Rural areas** report higher severity than urban areas
- 🚗 **Two-Wheelers** and **Pedestrians** are most vulnerable
- 🛣️ Certain road types (e.g. single carriageway) show higher fatality rate

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open `notebook/Road_Accident_Analysis.ipynb` in Google Colab
2. Upload the dataset from the `data/` folder
3. Run all cells to generate all insights and exports
4. Optionally, visualize insights using Power BI or Excel
